<p><strong><u>What is the purpose of this study?</strong></u> This study examines attitudes, preferences and beliefs about people of different demographic characteristics.</p>
<p><strong><u>What will I do if I choose to be in this study?</strong></u> You will read some instructions, answer some questions, and complete a few tasks such as categorizing words or pictures into groups as fast as possible. After completing this session, you will be contacted via an automated email service in 24 hours to complete a shorter second session.</p>
<p><strong><u>How long will I be in the study?</strong></u> This second session will take approximately 15 minutes to complete.</p>
<p><strong><u>What are the possible risks or discomforts?</strong></u> The possible risks from participating in this study are minimal. The risks are not greater than those ordinarily encountered in daily life. As in any research, there is a risk of breach of confidentiality. However, these risks are minimal given safeguards in place that protect confidentiality.</p>
<p><strong><u>Are there any potential benefits?</strong></u> There are no direct benefits of participating. You will have the opportunity to learn more about how research is conducted.  Some people may also experience greater self-awareness from their participation. Your willingness to take part may help society as a whole to better understand this research topic.</p>
<p><strong><u>Will I receive payment or other incentive?</strong></u> Participants will receive 1 experimental credit toward their experiment requirement for this session for a total of 2 credits. </p>
<p><strong><u>Will information about me and my participation be kept confidential?</strong></u> All the information you provide will be kept confidential, as well as your participation in this study. All information will be stored on password protected computers by collaborators at the University of Virginia. All data will be: (1) accessible only to people associated with this project at the University of Virginia and stored in rooms that have restricted access and/or are locked at all times; and (2) kept indefinitely on the data collection website Project Implicit and the Open Science Framework, but will be used only for the purposes described in this consent form. In addition, stored data will be de-identified and only reported at the aggregate level. Thus, your data will be combined with that of other participants and will be reported at the group level. The project's research records may be reviewed by departments at Purdue University and University of Virginia responsible for regulatory and research oversight. </p>
<p><strong><u>What are my rights if I take part in this study?</strong></u> Your participation in this study is voluntary.  You may choose not to participate or, if you agree to participate, you can withdraw your participation at any time without penalty or loss of benefits to which you are otherwise entitled.     </p>
<br/>
<p><strong><u>Who can I contact if I have questions about the study?</strong></u> This study examines attitudes, preferences and beliefs regarding people of different demographic characteristics.</p>
