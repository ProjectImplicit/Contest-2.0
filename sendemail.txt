Follow-Up Session for Project Implicit Study

Dear Project Implicit Research Participant,

Thank you very much for completing the first session of this study and for agreeing to be re-contacted. We are trying to understand more about how implicit associations change over time and we can not do it without volunteers like you! Your participation will help advance science. Over 75 percent of participants who have completed the first session come back for the second session. You can join your fellow participants to help advance science by coming back to take the second session.

By clicking the link at the bottom of this email, you will be directed to the second session.  The session you will take today is similar to what you did two days ago, but is only five minutes long. Please feel free to follow-up with us if you have any questions.
