<p><strong>IRB Study # 14-1981</strong></p>
<p><strong>Project Title: </strong>Attitudes and Beliefs</p>
<p><strong>Principal Investigator: </strong>Erin Cooley email: ecooley@live.unc.edu</p>
<p><strong>Faculty Advisor: </strong>Dr. B. Keith Payne email: bkpayne@live.unc.edu</p>
<p><strong>What are some general things you should know about research studies?</strong></p>
<p>You are being asked to take part in a research study. To join the study is voluntary. You may refuse to join, or you may withdraw your consent to be in the study, for any reason, without penalty. Details about this study are discussed below. It is important that you understand this information so that you can make an informed choice about being in this research study.</p>
<p><strong>What is the purpose of this study?</strong></p>
<p>This study examines attitudes, preferences and beliefs. </p>
<p><strong>How many people will take part in this study?</strong></p>
<p>If you decide to be in this study, you will be one of approximately 500 people in this research study from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. However, our goal is to collect over 4,000 participants across different psychology labs across the country. Because this study is a part of a larger collaboration with multiple researchers across the country, your data will be shared with these researchers. However, any data that is shared with these researchers will not include any identifying information about you (e.g., your email address).</p>
<p><strong>What will happen if you take part in the study?</strong></p>
<p>You will read some instructions, answer some questions, and complete a few tasks such as categorizing words or pictures into groups as fast as possible. After completing this session, you will be contacted again in 24 hours to complete a shorter second session.</p>
<p><strong>What are the possible benefits from being in this study?</strong></p>
<p>There are no direct benefits to you for participating in this research study.  </p>
<p><strong>What are the possible risks or discomforts involved from being in this study?</strong></p>
<p>We donâ€™t anticipate any risks in this study.</p>
<p><strong>How will your privacy be protected? </strong>The information that you give in the study will be handled confidentially.  Although we will collect your IP address and email address, any data connecting your name or email address to this code will be kept in only two places: in a password-protected personal computer and in a secure database which is maintained in a secure cluster maintained by Harvard Information Technology services. When the study is completed and the data have been analyzed, identifiable data will be deleted from the password-protected personal computer and will only be stored in the database.  Your name will not be used in any report.  </p>
<p><strong>What if you want to stop before your part in the study is complete? </strong>You can withdraw from this study at any time and without penalty. If you want to withdraw from the study, close the internet browser in which you are taking the study.</p>
<p><strong>Will you receive anything for being in this study? Will it cost anything? </strong>You will have the opportunity to receive 1 credit for participating in this study. This 1 credit will be divided into 0.5 credits awarded for completing Time 1 and another 0.5 credits awarded for completing Time 2. </p>
<p><strong>What if you have questions about this study?</strong></p>
<p>You have the right to ask, and have answered, any questions you may have about this research. Contact the principal investigator listed above with any questions, complaints, or concerns you may have.</p>
<p><strong>What if you have questions about your rights as a research participant?</strong></p>
<p>All research on human volunteers is reviewed by a committee that works to protect your rights and welfare. If you have questions or concerns, or if you would like to obtain information or offer input, please contact the Institutional Review Board at 919-966-3113 or by email to IRB_subjects@unc.edu.</p>
