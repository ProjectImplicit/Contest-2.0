The game has two parts, and will take less than five minutes.</p>		  <br/><b>Part 1: Word Memorization</b>		  <p>In the game you will see a number of faces. Below each face, a related word will appear. At the end of the game, you will be asked to recall as many of these words as possible. It might be difficult to pay attention to both the face and the word, but just try your best to <i>remember as many of the words as you can</i>.</p>		  <p>Please read the words silently to yourself as you see them. Reading the words silently to yourself may enhance your ability to remember them.</p>		  <p></p>		 		            <p class="textcenter"><script type="text/javascript">noDataButton("Continue");</script></p>        </td>      </tr>    </table>  </body></html>
