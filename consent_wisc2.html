<h3 align="center" class="text">Project Title: Implicit Social Cognition on the Internet</h3>
<p>You have been selected for this study because you are an adult of at least 18 years old. You are being contacted to complete the second session of a two-session study you began in the past couple of days. This study examines attitudes, preferences and beliefs. You will read some instructions, answer some questions, and complete a few tasks such as categorizing words or pictures into groups as fast as possible. This session will require about 5-10 minutes.</p>
<p>This study may help us understand how people think, and it may provide an educational, engaging experience. Project Implicit investigates thoughts and feelings and serves as the host for a timed online task you will complete. Project Implicit's standard <a href="javascript:void window.open('/implicit/privacypopup.html', 'FastResults', 'SCROLLBARS=YES,RESIZABLE=YES,WIDTH=300,HEIGHT=300');">privacy policy</a> applies to this study, as you will complete the short task through their software.</p>
<p>While there are no serious risks in the study, some of the tasks may make you feel uncomfortable. There are no direct benefits to you for participating in this research study.  Your participation in this study is voluntary. You may withdraw or skip questions at any time. The data acquired in today’s session will be connected to your data from yesterday’s session, but all identifying information will be deleted upon completion of the study. The study may help us understand how people think. At the end of the experiment, we will provide a thorough explanation of the experiment and of our hypotheses. We will describe the potential implications of the results of the study either if our hypotheses are supported or disconfirmed. The information that you give in the study will be handled confidentially.  Your information will be assigned a code number.  The list connecting your name to this code will be kept in a locked file.  When the study is completed and the data have been analyzed, this list will be destroyed.  Your name will not be used in any report. Participation in this study is voluntary, and you withdraw from the study or skip questions at any time. </p>
<p>You will receive .5 extra credit points for every half hour of participation or session in this study, rounded up to the nearest half hour. So you will receive .5 points for both sessions of the study. If you withdraw before completing the study, you will not receive extra credit points. </p>
<p>If you have questions about the research, you may contact the Principal Investigator Markus Brauer at brauer2@wisc.edu or 608.890.3313 or the student researcher, Sohad Murrar at smurrar@wisc.edu. If you are not satisfied with response of research team, have more questions, or want to talk with someone about your rights as a research participant, you should contact the Education and Social/Behavioral Science IRB Office at 608-263-2320. If participation makes you feel upset or uncomfortable in any way, please contact the UW-Madison University Health Services Counseling and Consultation Services at 608-265-5600 (option 2) or the 24-Hour Crisis Services at 608-265-5600 (option 9) for help.</p>
