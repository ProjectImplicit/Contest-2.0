<p><strong>Principal Investigator:</strong> Stefanie Simon</p>
<p><strong>Study Title:</strong> Implicit Social Cognition</p>
<p><strong>Performance Sites:</strong> Tulane University and University of Virginia</p>
<p><strong><u>Introduction</strong></u></p>
<p>You are invited to participate in a research study to explore attitudes, preferences, and beliefs. No research activity is to be conducted until you have had an opportunity to review this consent form, ask any questions you may have, and sign this document if applicable.</p>
<p><strong><u>What are the study procedures? What will I be asked to do?</strong></u></p>
<p>You will read some instructions, answer some questions, and complete a few tasks such as categorizing words or pictures into groups as fast as possible. After completing this session, you will be contacted again in 24 hours to complete a shorter second session. The study will require about 15 minutes for the first session and about 5 minutes for the second session.</p>
<p><strong><u>What other options are there?</strong></u></p>
<p>If you would like to earn credit in your course but do not wish to participate, you may choose from several other options including participating in the school psychology programâ€™s practice assessments (i.e., Psychological Assessment Points), attending specified eligible colloquia and writing a short report about the experience (i.e., Research Talks Points), or reading journal articles and writing short reports (i.e., Research Report Points). If you wish to receive extra credit in your course, but do not wish to participate in research tell the experimenter and he/she can provide you with an alternative way to earn extra credit. This alternative task involves reading a published research article and answering questions about the article.</p>
<p><strong><u>What are the risks or inconveniences of the study?  </strong></u></p>
<p>We believe there are no known risks associated with this research study; however, a possible inconvenience may be the time it takes to complete the study.</p>
<p><strong><u>What are the benefits of the study?</strong></u></p>
<p>You may not directly benefit from this research; however, we hope that your participation in the study may help us understand how people think. If you wish, you can send an email Calvin Lai (<a href="mailto:clai@virginia.edu">clai@virginia.edu</a>) who will send you a copy of any manuscripts based on the research (or summaries of our results).</p>
<p><strong><u>Will I receive payment for participation?</strong></u></p>
<p>You will not be paid to be in this study.</p>
<p><strong><u>Are there costs to participate?</strong></u></p>
<p>There are no costs to you to participate in this study. You will receive .5 credit in exchange for your participation.</p>
<p><strong><u>How will my personal information be protected?</strong></u></p>
<p>The following procedures will be used to protect the confidentiality of your data.  Your name will not be connected with your data in anyway. Research records will be labeled with a unique code.  A master key that links names and codes will be maintained in a separate and secure location.  All electronic files (e.g., database, spreadsheet, etc.) containing identifiable information will be password protected.  Any computer hosting such files will also have password protection to prevent access by unauthorized users.  Only the members of the research staff will have access to the passwords.  Data that will be shared with others will be coded as described above to help protect your identity.  At the conclusion of this study, the researchers may publish their findings.  Information will be presented in summary format and you will not be identified in any publications or presentations.  </p>
<p>You should also know that the Tulane University Human Research Protection Office, Social/Behavioral Institutional Review Board (IRB) and/or the Office of Research Compliance may inspect study records as part of its auditing program, but these reviews will only focus on the researchers and not on your responses or involvement.  The IRB is a group of people who review research studies to protect the rights and welfare of research participants.</p>
<p><strong><u>Can I stop being in the study and what are my rights?</strong></u></p>
<p>You do not have to be in this study if you do not want to.  If you agree to be in the study, but later change your mind, you may drop out at any time.  There are no penalties or consequences of any kind if you decide that you do not want to participate.</p>
<p><strong><u>Who do I contact if I have questions about the study?</strong></u></p>
<p>Take as much time as you like before you make a decision to participate in this study. We will be happy to answer any question you have about this study. If you have further questions about this study , want to voice concerns or complaints about the research or if you have a research-related problem, you may contact the principal investigator, (Stefanie Simon at <a href="mailto:ssimon3@tulane.edu">ssimon3@tulane.edu</a>) or (Calvin Lai at <a href="mailto:clai@virginia.edu">clai@virginia.edu</a>).  If you would like to discuss your rights as a research participant, discuss problems, concerns, and questions; obtain information; or offer input with an informed individual who is unaffiliated with the specific research, you may contact the Tulane University Human Research Protection Office at 504-988-2665 or email at <a href="mailto:irbmain@tulane.edu">irbmain@tulane.edu</a>.</p>
