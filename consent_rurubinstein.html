<h3 align="center" class="text">Informed Consent Agreement</h3>
<p><strong>Please read this consent agreement carefully before you decide to participate in the study.</strong></p>
<p>You are invited to participate in a research study in the Rutgers University Psychology Department in collaboration with many other universities, implemented by Rachel Rubinstein, a graduate student in the Rutgers University Psychology Department, and supervised by Dr. Brian Nosek, a Psychology faculty member at the University of Virginia.  The study will include over 4,000 participants across different universities; up to 400 of these participants will come from the present study being conducted at Rutgers University.  Rutgers participants will be students age 18 or older.  </p>
<p>Before you agree to participate in the study, you should know enough about it to make an informed decision.</p>
<p><strong>Purpose of the research study:</strong> This study examines attitudes, preferences and beliefs.</p>
<p><strong>What you will do in the study: </strong> You will read some instructions, answer questions, and complete a few tasks such as categorizing words or pictures into groups as fast as possible. You may also read a brief story or descriptions of people, or play a game of virtual dodgeball.  24 hours after completing this online task, you will be emailed the link to the second task, to be completed as soon as possible after receiving the link.  You will not receive credit for the second session unless you complete it 24-48 hours after the first study, so please be sure to adhere to this timeline closely.  The reason for this timeline is that it is important for all participants to complete the second half of the study after an approximately equal amount of time has elapsed.</p>
</ol>
<p><strong>Time required:</strong> The study will require about 20 minutes for the first session, and about 20 minutes for the second session.</p>
<p><strong>Risks:</strong> There are no anticipated risks in this study. </p>
<p><strong>Benefits:</strong> There are no direct benefits to you for participating in this research study.  However, the study may help us understand how people think, and it may provide an educational, engaging experience. At the end of the experiment, we will provide a thorough explanation of the experiment and of our hypotheses. We will describe the potential implications of the results of the study either if our hypotheses are supported or disconfirmed. If you wish, you can send an email to Brian Nosek (<a href="mailto:nosek@virginia.edu">nosek@virginia.edu</a>) or Calvin Lai (<a href="mailto:clai@virginia.edu">clai@virginia.edu</a>) and we will send you a copy of any manuscripts based on the research (or summaries of our results).
<p><strong>Confidentiality:</strong> Project Implicit's standard privacy policy applies to this study.  To safeguard data, Project Implicit uses the same secure hypertext transfer protocol (HTTPS), that banks and other commercial websites use to transfer credit card information in an encrypted format. This provides strong security for data transfer to and from our website.</p>
<p>Project Implicit uses transient or "session" cookies to track progress through individual studies. These session tags disappear once a web browser is closed. No permanent cookies will be stored on participant machines.</p>
<p>This research is confidential.  Confidential means that the research records will include some information about you and that this information will be stored in such a manner that some linkage between your identity and the response in the research exists.  The identifying information that will be collected in this research is your email address.  However, although we will record your email address, it will only be used to contact you with the link for the second session of the study, and to link the data from the first session with the data from the second session.  Your email address will be removed from the final dataset.  The research team and the Institutional Review Board at Rutgers University, University of Virginia, and other involved universities are the only parties that will be allowed to see the data, except as may be required by law.  If a report of this study is published, or the results are presented at t professional conference, only group results will be stated.  Data will be retained indefinitely; before reporting, only the principal investigator (Calvin Lai, a graduate student in the Psychology Department at the University of Virginia) and faculty advisor (Dr. Brian Nosek, a faculty member in the Psychology Department at the University of Virginia) will have direct access to the data and analyses.  After reporting, anonymous data will be made available at the Open Science Framework (<a href="http://openscienceframework.org/">http://openscienceframework.org/</a>) so that other investigators can verify or follow-up on the reported analyses. </p>
<p><strong>Voluntary participation:</strong> Your decision to participate or decline participation in this study is completely voluntary.</p>
<p><strong>Compensation:</strong> You will receive 1 RPU total for your participation: 0.5 RPUs for the first half, and 0.5 RPUs for the second half.  To reiterate, you will not receive credit for participating in the second half of the study unless it is completed 24-48 hours after the initial part of the study, so please be sure to adhere to this timeline closely.</p>
