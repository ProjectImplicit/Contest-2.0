Hi!

Several days ago, you took the first part of a two-part study for the psychology department at the University of Virginia and come back for a second session. We're trying to understand implicit associations and we can't do it without people like you! It's important that everyone participates. So, we have sent you a reminder email to take the second part of the study as soon as you can. Here's some info:

• This session only takes 5 minutes.
• The best results for this project will occur if you can complete this follow-up session right away. Please do it as soon as you can spare 5 minutes.
• You will get personalized feedback about your implicit associations.

Please click here to begin the follow-up:

Feel free to email me if you have any questions. Thank you!

Sincerely,
