REMINDER - Follow-Up Session for Psychology Study

Hi!

Several days ago, you took a study at Project Implicit and agreed to come back for a second session. We're trying to understand more about how implicit associations change over time and we can't do it without people like you! It's important that everyone participates. So, we have sent you a reminder email to take the study as soon as you can. Here's some info:

- We need almost all participants to complete the second session for this study. Join the many participants that have returned already to help make this project a success!
- This follow-up session will only take 5 minutes.
- We'll give you personalized feedback about your implicit associations. Will your implicit associations be the same or different compared to before?

Feel free to email me if you have any questions!

Thank you again for your time,
