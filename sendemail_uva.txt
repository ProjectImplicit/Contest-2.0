Follow-Up Session for Psychology Study

Hi!

Two days ago, you took a study at Project Implicit and consented to come back for a second session. We're trying to understand more about how implicit associations change over time and we can't do it without people like you! Here's some info:

- We need almost all participants to complete the second session for this study. Join the many participants that have returned already to help make this project a success!
- This follow-up session will only take 5 minutes.
- We'll give you personalized feedback about your implicit associations.
