<body>
<p>Imagine it's 3:00 a.m. and you have just spent the evening drinking in a bar with your friends. You're walking home alone and no one is around. There's no moon tonight, but the partial light-however dim-from an adjacent street allows you to place one foot in front of the other. Suddenly your path lightens as a car approaches from behind. Satisfied that you can see more than a few feet in front of you, you quicken your pace to make use of the fleeting light from the headlamps. 
</p>
<p>
Curiously, the vehicle comes to an abrupt, screeching halt next to you. Startled, you jump out of the way and turn toward what looks like a dark sedan in need of some repair. The headlights turn off. Almost immediately, you realize that the driver, a white man in his 40s, is pointing a pistol in your direction from inside his vehicle. "Say a single word and I'll shoot," he warns. Your hands instinctively reach for the sky, briefly, before you decide to flee in the opposite direction.</p>
<p>The man puts the car into reverse and turns sharply into you. Your kneecaps and pelvis crushed, you fall immediately to the ground face first. You're in enormous pain but know you must stay awake to try and fight; but with ease, the white man gets out of his car, picks you up, and throws you into his trunk. Although the noxious smell of burnt hair, rotting flesh, and motor oil makes you want to vomit, you press on, frantically searching around in the dark for a way out. Exhausted, your frantic scratching and pounding about turns into a desperate tapping-first on the interior of the rear of the car, then on the back seat. You begin to fear for your life. The car stops and the engine quiets down to a purr. The car door opens and closes.</p>

<p>As his footsteps approach you realize you've lost track of how many turns the driver has taken. You have no idea where you are. You don't know where to run or if your legs even work. The trunk flies open!</p>

<p>Seeing this as your chance, you quickly burst out of the car and attempt to sprint away. Armed with a crowbar, the white man quickly pivots and bashes you over the head, knocking you down yet again. With sadistic pleasure, he beats you again and again. First to the body, then to the head. You fight to keep your eyes open and your hands up. The last things you remember are the faint smells of alcohol and chewing tobacco and his wicked grin.

<p>Fortunately, a young black man driving by notices the empty car. He sees you in the distance being assaulted in the dark by the white man. Immediately, he calls the police and demands that the white man let you go. The white man drops the crowbar and tries to drag you back into his car. The black man sprints to tackle the assailant and a bloody fight ensues. After what seems like an eternity, the black man is finally able to gain the upper hand and knocks the white assailant out cold. Out of breath, the black man shouts, "Are you okay? Are you all right?" You try to respond, but your mouth is wet only with blood. You attempt a nod as flashes of red and blue and white light wash over the three of you.

<p>You are taken to the hospital and the policemen arrest the white assailant, who you later learn has had a previous record of aggravated assault, robbery, and attempted rape. You have suffered permanent damage to your knees, pelvis, torso, and head. It is unknown if you will walk again and you require major reconstructive surgery.
