<p>You are being asked to participate in a research study. Before you give your consent to volunteer, it is important that you read the following information and ask as many questions as necessary to be sure you understand what you will be asked to do.</p>
<p><strong><u>Investigators:</strong></u> Thierry Devos, Ph.D., Department of Psychology, San Diego State University, in collaboration with Calvin Lai and Brian Nosek, Ph.D., Department of Psychology, University of Virginia. </p>
<p><strong><u>Purpose of the Study:</strong></u> This study examines attitudes, preferences, and beliefs. Participants are recruited through the Department of Psychology subject pool. About 160 SDSU students will take part in this study.  </p>
<p><strong><u>Description of Procedure:</strong></u> You will read some instructions, answer some questions, and complete a few tasks such as categorizing words or pictures into groups as fast as possible. After completing this session, you will be contacted again in 24 hours to complete a shorter second session. You will complete both sessions online. The study will require about 15 minutes for the first session and about 5 minutes for the second session. You will be provided with a full debriefing about the purpose of the study once the second session is complete. </p>
<p><strong><u>Risks or Discomforts: </strong></u>There are minimal risks or discomforts anticipated to be associated with completing this study.  In research using the categorization tasks, participants often find the task to be interesting and even educational. However, some participants may experience discomfort while completing the task because of its potential to reveal associations of which they were previously unaware. Of course, you may discontinue your participation at any time.</p>
<p><strong><u>Benefits of this Study: </strong></u><i>Benefits to Participants.</i> There are no direct benefits to you for participating in this study. As a participant, you will have the opportunity to experience, first hand, psychological research. In taking part in the study, you may learn about how attitudes, preferences, and beliefs may be measured in ways other than standard questionnaires. In addition, you may find the study to be relevant to issues you care about. There is no guarantee that you will receive any benefits from participating in this study. <i>Benefits to Researchers.</i> The study may help us understand how people think. More precisely, it may provide answers to questions about the nature of and the processes underlying attitudes, preferences, and beliefs.</p>
<p><strong><u>Compensation: </strong></u>You will receive 0.5 research participation credit required in your psychology course for your participation in this study. There are no costs associated with participation. </p>

<p><strong><u>Voluntary Nature of Participation: </strong></u>Participation in this study is voluntary. Your choice of whether or not to participate will not influence your future relations with San Diego State University, or the San Diego State University Research Foundation. If you decide to participate, you are free to withdraw your consent and to stop your participation at any time without penalty or loss of benefits to which you are allowed. Likewise, while we encourage your participation, you may choose not to complete certain tasks or questionnaires, without penalty. If you want to withdraw or discontinue your participation from the study, close the study. You will still receive full credit for the study. </p>
<p><strong><u>Questions about the Study: </strong></u>If you have any questions about the research now or later, you may contact Thierry Devos (telephone: 619-594-6911; e-mail: tdevos@mail.sdsu.edu). </p>
<p>If you have questions regarding your rights as a human subject and participant in this study, you may contact the San Diego State University Institutional Review Board at telephone: 619-594-6622; e-mail: irb@mail.sdsu.edu.</p>
<p><strong><u>Consent to Participate: </strong></u>The San Diego State University Institutional Review Board has approved this consent form. The consent form must be reviewed annually and will expire a year after it has been approved.  </p>
