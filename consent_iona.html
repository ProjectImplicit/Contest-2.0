	<li>Brief tutorial about habitual tendencies and asking participants to try to go against those tendencies</li>
	<li>Brief tutorial on trying to slow down or speed up when categorizing certain words and images</li>
	<li>Reading a vivid evocative story in which YOU are the victim of a violent crime and are helped by an onlooker </li>
	<li>Reading an evocative story in which you are helped by friends or attacked by rival groups</li>
	<li>Reading about membership in a sports team and interaction with teammates and opponents</li>
	<li>Adopting a certain viewpoint</li>
	<li>Categorization of words and images (Control Condition)</li>

<p><strong>RIsks:</strong> There are no anticipated risks in this study. </p>
<p><strong>Benefits:</strong> There are no direct benefits to you for participating in this research study.  The study may help us understand how people think. At the end of the experiment, we will provide a thorough explanation of the experiment and of our hypotheses. We will describe the potential implications of the results of the study either if our hypotheses are supported or disconfirmed. If you wish, you can send an email to Brian Nosek (<a href="mailto:nosek@virginia.edu">nosek@virginia.edu</a>) or Calvin Lai (<a href="mailto:clai@virginia.edu">clai@virginia.edu</a>) and we will send you a copy of any manuscripts based on the research (or summaries of our results).</p>
<p><strong>Confidentiality:</strong> Only the research team will have access to the raw data.  However, please remember that in the first session, you will provide your email address.

Once you complete both sessions, your data from the two sessions will be joined and then your email will be discarded and your personal responses will never appear individually, but only as averaged data.

<p><strong>Right to withdraw from the study:</strong> You have the right to withdraw from the study at any time without penalty. You may skip any questions you do not wish to answer.
