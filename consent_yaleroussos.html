<p><strong>Purpose:</strong></p>
<p>We are conducting a research study to examine attitudes, preferences, and beliefs online.</p>
<p><strong>Procedures:</strong></p>
<p>You will read some instructions, answer some questions, and complete a few tasks such as categorizing words or pictures into groups as fast as possible. After completing this session, you will be contacted again in several days to complete a shorter second session. The study will require about 30 minutes for the first session and about 30 minutes for the second session. You will receive 1.0 course credit for completing both parts of the study.</p>
<p><strong>Risks and Benefits:</strong></p>
<p>We do not anticipate any risks; particularly given this kind of study has been conducted extensively in the past with minimal risk. You may feel uncomfortable during the brief period of the experiment, but you will be debriefed at the end of the study which should ameliorate any discomfort you felt during the experiment. There may not be any direct benefits for the participants, but findings from this work will inform work on social attitudes in real-world settings.</p>
<p><strong>Confidentiality:</strong></p>
<p>All of your responses will be anonymous. Your academic email address will be recorded during the study only to identify and link the first and second sessions of the study. Once you complete both portions of the study, your email address will be deleted from the data. Only the researchers involved in this study and those responsible for research oversight, (<i>such as representatives of the Yale University Human Research Protection Program, and the Yale University Human Subjects Committee, offices responsible for fiscal monitoring if applicable</i>) will have access to any information that could identify your responses.</p>
<p>When we publish any results from this study we will do so in a way that does not identify you unless we get your specific permission to do so. We may also share the anonymous data online with other researchers so that they can check the accuracy of our conclusions.</p>
<p><strong>Voluntary Participation:</strong></p>
<p>Participation in this study is completely voluntary. You are free to decline to participate, to end participation at any time for any reason, or to refuse to answer any individual question. Refusing to participate will involve no penalty or loss of benefits or compensation to which you are otherwise entitled or affect your relationship with Yale University.</p>
<p>Your participation in this study is extremely valuable for our research, and we hope that participating will prove to be an educational experience for you. In addition, however, please remember that this is only one of the ways in which you can fulfill your "experimental participation" credits for Introduction to Psychology. Other ways, as detailed in the form handed out to you in class, include serving as an observer of 5 experiments, or arranging for other options of equivalent educational value (e.g., writing essays) through your instructor.</p>
