<h3 align="center" class="text">Participant Informed Consent Form</h3>
<h3 align="left" class="text">IRB #</h3>
<p><strong>Implicit Social Cognition</p></strong>
<p><strong>Please read this consent agreement carefully before you decide to participate in the study. You are eligible to participate in this study if you are a UNL student age 18 or older. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Purpose of the research study:</strong> This study examines attitudes, preferences and beliefs. </p>
<p><strong>Procedure:</strong> This study is being conducted in collaboration with the University of Virginia. You will read some instructions, answer some questions, and complete a few tasks such as categorizing words or pictures into groups as fast as possible. After completing this session, you will be contacted again in 24 hours to complete a shorter second session. </p>
<p>The study will require about 15 minutes for the first session and about 5 minutes for the second session.</p>
<p><strong>Benefits:</strong> There are no direct benefits to you for participating in this research study.  The study may help us understand how people think. At the end of the experiment, we will provide a thorough explanation of the experiment and of our hypotheses. We will describe the potential implications of the results of the study either if our hypotheses are supported or disconfirmed. If you wish, you can send an email to Brian Nosek (nosek@virginia.edu) or Calvin Lai (clai@virginia.edu) and we will send you a copy of any manuscripts based on the research (or summaries of our results).</p>
<p><strong>Risks:</strong> There are no anticipated risks in this study. </p>
<p><strong>Confidentiality:</strong> The information that you give in the study will be handled confidentially. Your name will not be used in any report.  Email addresses will be used to contact participants for follow-up sessions and link data from the two research test sessions. However, only the primary test site (University of Virginia) principal investigator will have access to your email address. This information will be permanently archived to the Project Implicit web server with participant data. The current security and archiving system has been operating effectively since 2002, with more than 16 million completed study sessions in its lifetime (e.g., >160,000 studies of "normal" size) and more than 1000 studies completed.  The system has had continuous IRB oversight and approval starting with Yale and University of Washington in 1998 and, since 2002, University of Washington, Harvard, University of Virginia, and more recently adding University of Florida.   </p>
<p><strong>Compensation: </strong>You will receive 0.5 research participation credit required in your psychology course for your participation in this study. There are no costs associated with participation. </p>
<p><strong>Freedom to Withdraw: </strong>You may ask any questions concerning this research and have those questions answered before agreeing to participate in or during the study by contacting the research, Allison Skinner (<a href="mailto:allisonlskinner@gmail.com">allisonlskinner@gmail.com</a>). Please contact the University of Nebraska-Lincoln Institutional Review Board at (402) 472-6965 to voice concerns about the research or if you have any questions about your rights as a research participant.</p>
<p><strong>Questions about the Study: </strong>Your participation in the study is completely voluntary. You have the right to withdraw from the study at any time without penalty. If you want to withdraw from the study, close the study. There is no penalty for withdrawing. You will still receive full credit for the experiment.</p>
<p>Psychological treatment is available in the event of any discomfort resulting from participation in the study, given that you may be presented with information about personal characteristics (e.g., social bias) that could influence your self-concept. Psychological treatment is available at free or reduced cost at the UNL Counseling and Psychological Services Center, which can be reached at (402) 472-5000. </p>
