<p><strong>Principal Investigator: Meghan McLean</strong></p>
<p><strong>Project Title: Social Attitudes and Beliefs</strong></p>
<h3 align="center" class="text">Informed Consent Form</h3>
<p>You are invited to participate in a research study that is being conducted by Meghan McLean, who is a graduate student in the psychology Department at Rutgers University. The purpose of this research is to study attitudes, preferences and beliefs.</p>
<p>Approximately 500 subjects between the ages of 18 and 23 years old will participate in the study, and each individual's participation will last approximately 20 minutes during session 1 and 20 minutes 24 hours later at session 2. </p>
<p>Participation in this study involves the following: You will read some instructions, answer some questions, and complete a few tasks such as categorizing words or pictures into groups as fast as possible. After completing this session, you will be contacted again in 24 hours to complete a shorter second session. </p>
<p>This research is confidential. Confidential means that the research records will include some information about you and this information will be stored in such a manner that some linkage between your identity and the response in the research exists. Some of the information collected about you includes your social attitudes and beliefs such as your political orientation. These results will be associated with your email address until the end of the semester when your email address will be permanently deleted from our data. Your email address will only be used to link your responses to both surveys. Please note that we will keep this information confidential by limiting individual's access to the research data and keeping it in a secure location on the experimenter's computer.</p>
<p>The research team and the Institutional Review Board at Rutgers University are the only parties other than a collaborator at the University of Virginia that will be allowed to see the data, except as may be required by law. If a report of this study is published, or the results are presented at a professional conference, only group results will be stated. All study data will be kept for <u>3 years.</u></p>
<p>There are no foreseeable risks to participation in this study. You have been told that the benefits of taking part in this study may be that it could help us understand how people think. However, you may receive no direct benefit from taking part in this study. </p>
<p>You will receive 1.0 RPU in total for completing session 1 and session 2. </p>
<p>After completing this session, you will be contacted again in 24 hours to complete a shorter second session. </p>
<p>Participation in this study is voluntary. You may choose not to participate, and you may withdraw at any time during the study procedures without any penalty to you. In addition, you may choose not to answer any questions with which you are not comfortable.</p>
